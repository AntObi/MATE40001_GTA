    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** \n",
    "In order to do some of these exercises, you might have to dig into the lecture notes in the relevant section!  \n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the properties of the data types called \"tuples\" and \"sets\". These are described in Lecture notes 1.04 and 1.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Summary:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** is a collection, without any specific order, of distinct and heterogeneous ( = not necessarily of the same type ) variables. The elements of a set must be declared within brakets {}, separated by a comma, or using the set() command. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myVariable = { 1, 2, 34 } or\n",
    "myVariable = set( [ 1, 2, 34 ] )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets have the same properties you would expect for a mathematical set, so you can do unions,\n",
    "intersections, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **tuple** is very similar to a list, but its element once set cannot be changed. For this reason, all operations that you have seen on list can be done on tuples as well, except those that change the elements in a list (with the only exception of adding an element at the end of the tuple, which can be done as in lists). \n",
    "A tuple declaration is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myTuple = ( 1, 2, 3 ) or,\n",
    "myTuple = tuple( [ 1, 2, 3 ] )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** A tuple with a single element must be declared using a comma at the end:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myTuple = ( 1, )  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and **NOT** as \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myTuple = ( 1 )\n",
    "```"
