    "## Classes: defining new Python objects from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to define new Python \"objects\", or so-called \"classes\". \n",
    "\n",
    "A Python object is nothing but a **new data type, that can be generated\n",
    "from those which you are already familiar with** ( lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, ...)\n",
    "or, more generally, any previously defined object. For example, you can first define\n",
    "a class, then use it inside some other class's definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility to define arbitrary objects/data types is what makes Python and other object-oriented languages extremely powerful and flexible!  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal declaration, the `__init__` function and data attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The **minimal** definition of a class should have the following form (with some caveats, see later in the final remarks):  \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class myNewClass( ):\n",
    "\n",
    "   def __init__( self, input1, input2, ..., keywordArg1 = X, keywordArg2 = Y , ...):\n",
    "     self.dataAttributeX = input1 \n",
    "     self.dataAttributeY = input2\n",
    "     ...\n",
    "     self.aDefaultAttribute = value1\n",
    "     self.anotherDefaultAttribute = value2\n",
    "     return()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `self` is literally the word `self`, whereas dataAttributeX, \n",
    "dataAttributeY, ... are so called *data attributes* of the class and `myNewClass` \n",
    "is the name of the new object we just defined. Note that attributeX, attributeY, ..., \n",
    "myNewClass could be any valid name of your choice. For example, I could have written \n",
    "`self.var1` instead of `self.dataAttributeX` and I could have called the class \n",
    "`bestObjectEver` instead of `myNewClass`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to notice is that because \n",
    "the input to the `__init__` function (\"double underscore init double underscore\") are \n",
    "used to define values that will differ between between different instances of the same class\n",
    "(different variables of the same type of class), a class can also be provided with some \n",
    "default value that is general to all of them (the `value1` and `value2` in the declaration above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical and simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class person():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__( self, input1, input2, name = \"Stefano\" ):\n",
    "        self.myAge = input1\n",
    "        self.myGender = input2       \n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.money = 100         \n",
    "      \n",
    "        return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: the `__init__` function of a class should not provide any return value, so the \n",
    "last line is literally **only** `return`, and **nothing** else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a class has been defined, you can create a variable with that data type. In Python jargon, the associated variable is called an  \n",
    "**instance** of the class (and similarly you can say the class has been \"instantiated\" once you assigned it to a specific variable). In other words, we created a Python object with the properties \n",
    "of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general declaration for instatiation goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    " varName = nameOfClass( input1, input2 )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so in our case, referring to the previous example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "person1 = person( 33, 'female', name = \"Sandrine\"  )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are doing in this way is to declare that `person1` is an instance of the object of type \"person\". Also, by this declaration we have assigned the value 33 to `input1`, the value\n",
    " \"female\" to input2 and we have over-written the default value of `name` with \"Sandrine\". \n",
    " \n",
    " Once an object has been instantiated, we can retrieve the values of any data attribute with the general\n",
    " declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    " nameOfclassInstance.attributeName\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, taking again the example from above (and assuming with have created the variable `person1` of type\n",
    "`person` as previously defined), `print( person1.name )` would print out \"Sandrine\", or `person1.age + 2` would give as a result `35`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about the value of `self`???\n",
    " \n",
    "In the previous example of class instantiation, you might have thought there was an error: the input values\n",
    "of the `__init__` function were `self, input1, input2, name`, but we have said the first value used in the class \n",
    "instantiation would be assigned to `input1` and the second to `input2` and you might wonder...what is the value of `self`? \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact is that, for the `__init__` function (and, actually *any* class-specific function, which we will see later) the first value in the function *declaration* is always the word `self`. However, when you make an *instance* of the class you **do not** need to provide its input value because `self` is automatically taken to be *the variable to which the class was instantiated*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confused? An example is better than a thousand words, so let's see one! First, read, and then run the cell below:"
