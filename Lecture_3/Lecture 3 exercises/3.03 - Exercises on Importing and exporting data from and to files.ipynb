    "In many cases, you need to work with or plot data that are stored in an external file. Importing these data in Python can be done by using the `loadtxt()` function, which is part of the \n",
    "numpy package. To do that, you need first to load the package numpy with the same import command we have seen previously with the matplotlib library.\n",

Note that if the file is not in the same directory/folder from which you launched the Jupyter Notebook, the whole 'address' should be included in the filename. For example, if the file myData.txt is under the directory /usr/Stefano/home/Desktop, 'name of file' should be '/usr/Stefano/home/Desktop/myData.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `skiprows` is an optional argument of the function `loadtxt`, and basically tells the Python interpreter to import all data but skipping a certain number of rows in the file ( which are often used to write comments about what the data represent ) \n",
