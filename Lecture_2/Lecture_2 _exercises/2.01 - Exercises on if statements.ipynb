    "\n",
    "**Quick Summary**\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the use of so called \"conditional statements\", covered in Section 2 of the lecture notes. Conditional statements are used in Python to make sure a series of instructions are executed **if** a certain condition is met, but not otherwise. It is one of the main ingredients to build a program!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The typical structure of these statements is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if ( some condition ):\n",
    "    some instruction\n",
    "elif (another condition):\n",
    "    some different instruction\n",
    "else:   \n",
    "    something else to do\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `( some condition )` can be **any** logical statement that returns a `True`/`False` value. These can be built by using the logical operators:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `&` / `and` : the logical AND operator\n",
    "- `!` / `not` : the NOT (negation) operator\n",
    "- `|` / `or` : the logical OR operator\n",
    "- `==` : comparison  (as in `A == B` checks if A is equal to B and in this case returns True, False otherwise )\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with the way logical operators work and they way to combine them, have a look on Wikipedia clicking [here]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table}. An elementary math textbook, however, might be clearer :P!\n"
