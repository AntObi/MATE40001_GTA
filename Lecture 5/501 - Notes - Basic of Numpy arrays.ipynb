    "## Introduction to the Numpy library \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will learn a few features of the **Numpy** library (from Numerical Python). \n",
    "\n",
    "Together with Scipy of which we will see more next year (but you should now be able to read its documentation and learn about it on the [project page]()!), these are possibly the two most important libraries in Python when it comes to scientific computing. Note also that many other various libraries, for example for Machine Learning, are built relying on some of the functions and objects defined in Numpy!\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, NumPy contains, among other things:\n",
    "- A powerful object, the **numpy array**. It is so ubiquitous that we will just call it array, without further specifications. Arrays are possibly the most important part of the Numpy package, especially considering that almost any other package having to do any sort of heavy computation is actually built on them. The reason for their widespread usage is that numpy arrays allow very fast [vectorized computation](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/VectorizedOperations.html). \n",
    "- Sophisticated mathematical functions\n",
    "- Packages for linear algebra, random number generation (which we will see in the next lecture!) and Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect to keep in mind is that, although we would not cover this aspect in this course, Numpy contains tools for interfacing other coding languages such as C/C++ (\"Cyton\") and Fortran (\"F2Py\") with Python, which is useful to combine the (much better) computational performance of these other programming languages with the ease and flexibility of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An important note\n",
    "\n",
    "The Numpy library is gigantic and **we will not cover all of it in the short time we have**. In fact, we will concentrate on *numpy arrays* and on the sub-library that allows us to generate random numbers (because it is quite important for different kind of computational modelling techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations). However, you can find the most comprehensive documentation describing the whole Numpy library in the [Numpy project page](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/index.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also suggest you to read this recent [review appeared on the journal Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2) specifically on numpy Arrays, which besides providing an historical perspective on their development it describes the direction in which the Python community is pushing this project."

    "### The Numpy arrays class: attributes and selected methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A numpy array or simply array (the actual exact Python name being *ndarray*) is a **n-dimensional array of homogeneous data types**, for example, an ordered sequence of numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Superficially, it might simply look like a less flexible Python list, because its elements *must* be of the same type (this is what we mean by homogeneous) instead of being a (potentially) heterogeneous collection like lists. There are indeed some useful properties of lists that have also been copied by numpy arrays, in particular with respect to the way we manipulate them. For example, each element of an array `a` can be retrieved by providing the set of indexes corresponding to its position. Similarly, pieces of a numpy array can be taken by slicing it as we do in lists and numpy arrays are also copied by reference. However, this is possibly where the similarities stop and important differences begin. Let us see a few of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations on numpy array are performed in compiled code (instead of being executed line by line like in a Python list), which drastically accelerates performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike lists which can be increased on the fly ( reminder: using the `.append()` method ). If instead you try to change the size of an array, what happens is that a new array is created and the original is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy arrays are required to contain elements of the same data type\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy arrays speed up certain basic mathematical operations on a large number of data through \"vectorization\" (more later below), whereas lists operate sequentially. This is possible because any operation on numpy arrays is defined element-wise, which helps writing much more more compact and easy to read codes, in many cases substituting loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "If what is written in the list above is not clear, do not worry. We will have a look at some examples to illustrate all these concepts!"

    "#### Creating a Numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to instantiate ( = create ) a one-dimensional numpy array is the following:\n",
    "   \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myArray = np.array( [a list of objects of the same type] )\n",
    "```\n",
    "for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "myArray = np.array( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ])\n",
    "myArray = np.array( [1, 2, 3, 4 ], dtype = float )\n",
    "```\n",
    "where in the second case we have added the optional argument `dtype = typeOfData`, where `typeOfData` can be any valid data type, for example, `float` or `int`, although Python typically recognises which data type you want to use by the form in which it is provided in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see a few examples of how numpy arrays work, including similarities and differences with lists. **Read and run the cells below to see what happens**. As usual, before running them *think about what you expect to see*.\n"

    "#### Masked Arrays\n",
    " \n",
    "Masked arrays are a slightly different type of object from normal numpy arrays (in fact, they have been derived from it, in the sense that they **inherited** most of standard arrays functionalities).    \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, masked arrays have been developed to work with arrays that may have missing or invalid entries, a common situation when dealing with large dataset. For example, a sensor may have failed to record a data, or recorded a negative value due to malfunctioning for a quantity like the absolute temperature, which we know can only be positive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use masked arrays, we need to import the `numpy.ma` module of the standard numpy library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import numpy.ma as ma  # (we load the subpackage numpy.ma, this has to be done once only)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can instantiate masked arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a masked array is the combination of a standard numpy array and a **mask**. When instantiating a masked array, this mask can be set to `nomask`, indicating that no value of the associated array is invalid, or it can be another array, of the same length, containing booleans values (`True/1` or `False/0`) that determine, for each element of the associated array, whether the value is valid or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It might be a bit counterintuitive but actually **when an element of the mask is `False`, the corresponding element of the associated array is valid** and is said to be **unmasked**. When an element of the mask is `True`, the corresponding element of the associated array is said to be **masked** (invalid).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general declaration to instantiate (create a variable of type) masked arrays is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "var = ma.masked_array( array, mask )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `array` is a numpy array and `mask` an array of boolean (`True` or `False`) values, which for obvious reasons must be of the same length as `array`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make an example (read until the end then run the cell to see what happens). Here, we wish to mark all negative values as invalid and then take the average of the remaining ones. With a masked array, this can be done easily via:"
