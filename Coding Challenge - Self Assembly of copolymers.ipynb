    "# However, we will see a technique that is effectively used to model them.\n",
    "# In fact, we are going to write a code for doing Monte Carlo simulations (of a simple type)\n",
    "# and use it to study the self-assembly of co-polymers confined to a surface.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We will use a simple \"bead-spring\" description of the polymer, which will be described\n",
    "# as a set of beads bonded with an harmonic potential. If you want, think about a bead as if\n",
    "# it was a monomer of the polymer (...although somehow this is an approximation...)\n",
    "# As in normal polymers, some beads are connected by a bond, some are not. Two connected beads \n",
    "# provide a contribution to the total energy of the system given by a spring-like model, hence: \n",

    "# is the spring constant, describing in practice the stiffness of the bond between the beads.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this model, all pair of beads, whether bonded or not (and regardless of whether or not they\n",
    "# belong to the same polymer) interact with an additional potential of the form ( it is called the \n",
    "# Lennard-Jones potential, and we use it here just to approximate the real interactions! ):\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ELJ_(i,j) = 4 * epsilon * ( ( sigma / |r| )**12 - ( sigma / |r| )**6 )\n",
    "# \n",
    "# In our model, we also put a cutoff to the function, so we set ELJ = 0 if |r| > rcutoff.\n",
    "# We choose rcutoff = 2.5 sigma\n",
    "# \n",
    "# We are looking at co-polymers, and each copolymer is made by monomers of different type.\n",
    "# For simplicity, let's assume only two types, which we will refer to as A and B.\n",
    "# The parameter epsilon is related to the strength of the interaction, whereas sigma plays the\n",

    "# The value of epsilon will be different depending on the specific pair of bead types we consider.\n",
    "# Thus, in our system we will have three values of epsilon: eps_AA, eps_AB = eps_BA, eps_BB,\n",
    "# corresponding to the 3 different potential combinations of A and B. We will also have two different\n",
    "# values of sigma, sigma_A (for an AA pair) and sigma_B (for a BB pair). For an AB pair, sigma_AB is \n",

    "#    the energy of the system. In our case, this function is\n",
    "#    Etot = sum(i,j) Eharmonic_(i,j) + ELJ(i,j), where the sum extends to all possible \n",
    "#    pairs of beads i and j in the system. Note however that Eharmonic will be zero if\n",
    "#    i and j are not bonded together. Moreover, ELJ will also be zero if the distance \n",

    "#\n",
    "# You then have to evolve the system using the following rules: \n",
    "# 1) Pick a random particle in the system\n",
    "# 2) Generate a random move\n",
    "# 3) Calculate the change in energy due to the random move (let's call it DE )\n",
    "# 4) If DE < 0 accept the new configuration. If DE > 0 then\n",
    "#    i) Calculate a = exp( - DE / kT )\n",
    "#    ii) Extract a random number X between (0,1)\n",
    "#    iii) If X < a: accept the new configuration, otherwise remain in the old configuration\n",
    "# 5) Every \"nSample\" attempted steps (it does not matter if reject or accepted, it is very\n",
    "#    important to do exactly this!), take a record of the system to analyse it later. \n",
    "#    By record of the system one means the particle positions, from which everything else\n",

    "#\n",
    "# Here are a few more important instruction:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1)Your code should take as input a dictionary, defining the number and type of polymers in the system, \n",
    "#    and the number \"nSteps\", the number of Monte Carlo (MC) steps you will need to run the algorithm for.\n",
    "#    The dictionary describing the system should have the form:\n",
    "#    mySystem = { \"type1\" : { \"number\": X1, \"La\" : N1, \"Lb\" : N2 } }, where:\n",
    "#    typeX is just the name you give to a certain type of polymer.\n",
    "#    Each polymer of the same type is characterised by the number of beads of type A, given by La, \n",
    "#    and that of typeB, given by Lb. In total, there are a certain number of polymers of this type \n",
    "#    in your system, specified by \"number\"\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2) The initial positions of all the beads of the system can be taken randomly (note, however, that\n",
    "#    each bead should have some information regarding to what are the bead it is bonded to, in order to\n",
    "#    calculate the energy). It can be mathematically\n",
    "#    proven that in a MC simulation, regardless of the initial state the system will tend to the same \n",
    "#    equilibrium values!\n",
    "#    However, we confine our system to a 2D plane of size Lbox * Lbox. If during the simulation a random\n",
    "#    movement of the bead brings it outside of it, we immediately reject that move (this corresponds to\n",
    "#    having a system where there are impenentrable walls at its boundaries)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3) A random displacement for a bead can be generated by:\n",
    "#    i) choose randomly between moving in x or y direction (remember we are in 2D only)\n",
    "# .  ii) choose any random number in the interval ( -dxMax, dxMax ), where dxMax is a simulation parameter\n",
    "#    Your results (it can be mathematically proven!) do not depend on the choice of dxMax, although the \n",
    "#    time for the system to equilibrate will. For now, just pick dxMax = 0.2 sigma_A\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4) If you have N beads in the system, there will be N*(N-1)/2 pairs to be accounted for in the calculation\n",
    "#    of the energy. When N starts to be large (for example, 10**3 or 10**4) we are starting to talk about\n",
    "#    millions or billions of calculations to make, which is complex even for a computer!\n",
    "#    However, note that there is an energy contribution only for neighbours within rcutoff, so we don't really \n",
    "#    care about others...this provides us with a way to do things more efficiently, which is:\n",
    "#    i) For each bead, we calculate which of those are its neighbours. If done \"intelligently\", this calculation\n",
    "#    requires a number of operations that is proportional to N, not N**2. In fact, you should do it, by \n",
    "#    encoding the algorithm called \"cell lists\". You can find the algorithm here: \n",
    "#    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lists  ( for now, you can forget about so-called \"periodic boundary \n",
    "#    conditions\"...but ask if you want to know more )\n",
    "#    ii) Once you know the neighbours of each bead, you can calculate only the energy due to the neighbours only.\n",
    "#    This step also takes a number of operations proportional to N, so that in total i) and ii) take a number \n",
    "#    of operations that also grows as N instead of N**2\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5) You should be recording the value of the energy and the position of the particles every nSample steps and \n",
    "#    print them into separate files which can be later used for analysis. In fact, for the case of the position\n",
    "#    you want to store not only the position of each particle but also its type. You should then program a function\n",
    "#    that, given the file with the type and position of the particles, plots them as a set of points, where points\n",
    "#    of different colour will correspond to beads of different type. These plots will allow you to visualize \n",
    "#    self assembly!\n",
    "#    Finally, you should also have a routine that, given the file with the energy, returns a plot of the energy as a \n",
    "#    function of the MC steps performed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# With the code so-defined, perform different simulations changing the values defining the system and see how (and if)\n",
    "# you can observe different types of structures assemblying, and in which conditions. Besides the code, you should \n",
    "# give me representative snapshot of the system for different values of aa = sigma_A / sigma_B and \n",
    "# bb = La / Lb. I also want to see a plot, that you can report as a heatmap, of the average energy of the system \n",
    "# as a function of aa and bb.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In your simulations, take all other parameters fixed to the following values:\n",
    "# sigma_A = 1\n",
    "# eps_AA = eps_BB = 5 kT\n",
    "# eps_AB = 1 kT\n",
    "# Lbox = 40\n",
    "# And there should be a total of 50 polymers each containing 10 beads each (how many of type A and B depends on the\n",
    "# chosen value for \"bb\" above).\n",
    "# Note that as eps is given as a multiple of kT (the so-called thermal energy, k = Boltzmann constant and T being\n",
    "# temperature), there is no need to set the temperature as the Boltzmann probability will be independent on it \n",
    "# (kT cancels out!)\n",
    "# By the way, once you see the code works, if you are curious you should be experimenting with different values of eps, or \n",
    "# different concentration of polymers (total number / Lbox**2 ) and see what happens. Self-assembly will truly depend\n",
    "# on all of them!\n",
    "#   \n",
    "# One last note: all of this can be coded in different ways but you should be trying to do this splitting the problem \n",
    "# into the necessary classes. Just to make an example, you might want to have a class \"bead\", which contains the \n",
    "# position of the bead, and the index of the beads bonded to it, as well as functions to calculate what is the \n",
    "# energy contribution if you move that specific bead.\n",
    "# Similarly, you might want to have a class, let's call it \"System\" which contains as elements all the beads in your\n",
    "# system, as well as data regarding the size of the box for the simulation and other routines that might allow you\n",
    "# to calculate the system state and print it out...\n",
    "# Thus, The first step to take is NOT to start coding but to take some time to think about how to structure the code\n",
    "# and thus how to divide up the work between the members of the group (for example, each one could be coding\n",
    "# a class, once its structure (data attributes and methods) has been decided collectively...but this I leave it\n",
